                    Lakshadweep is the tiniest Union Territory of India and is its only coral island chain. The islands have a total area of 32 sq.kms and the lagoons enclosed by the atolls cover an area of 4200 sq.kms. Its territorial waters extend to 20,000 sq.kms and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to 4,00,000 sq.kms. Only 10 of these islands namely, Agatti, Amini, Andrott, Bitra, Chetlat, Kadmat, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Kiltan and Minicoy are inhabited. Kavaratti is the Administrative Headquarters of the Union Territory. It is culturally very close to the nearest mainland Indian state of Kerala and Malayalam is a widely spoken language apart from local dialects. Minocy Island has a different language by the name Mahl.

                    Early history of Lakshadweep is unwritten. Local traditions attribute the first settlement on these islands to the period of Cheraman Perumal, the legendary king of Kerala. Though it is commonly believed that the first settlers in these islands were the ship-wrecked sailor who had set out to Mecca in search of Cheraman Perumal, the legendary king of Kerala, studies are being continued about the settlement.

                    <br />
                    Earlier, life in these Islands was hard and challenging. Foreign traders and travellers held sway in these islands to explore itâ€™s natural beauty. Quite often the islanders were subject to their savage cruelties. The events in these geographically isolated islands were never known to the outside world.
